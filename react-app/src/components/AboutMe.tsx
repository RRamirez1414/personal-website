          I&#39;m an extensive web developer from El Paso, TX. My focus is on
          front-end programming with a good apprehension of back-end
          development. I have experience working with JavaScript, TypeScript,
          React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I enjoy working in a team where
          we enhance each otherâ€™s programming knowledge and skills through
          projects. I strive for structure, quality, and love incorporating time
          for app optimization. I&#39;m always looking to learn new technologies
          and improve my skills.
